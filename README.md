## About the Project

This spreadsheet is a personal project of mine which I gained inspiration from trying to transform my eating habits. After searching the internet for advice on how to improve my overall diet, I found that a key component of losing weight (and in turn, losing body fat - one of my primary goals) was eating in a calorie deficit.

## Built With
The following the softwares and languages were used to implement this spreadsheet.
* Excel
* VBA
* Python
Excel was chosen to build the user interface since it was the platform I felt most comfortable using at the time, in addition to the simplicity of distributing it to other users as well. VBA was used to implement most of the background functionality of the spreadsheet, while Python scripts were developed in order to utilize API's which retrieved requested nutrition facts from an online database.
